# Dot

### TODO

- Learn Rust
- Error handling
- Don't copy pesky system files like `.DS_Store`
- Copy files recursively
  - Don't make a symlink for the file, instead make the directories and only
    symlink the file.
- Add ability to have pre/post hooks?
- Add ability to have host or tag specific files
- Add CLI options like `-v` for version
- Add dot-dn or similar to remove symlinks created by dot
- Add ls-dot or similar to list symlinks created by dot
- Add mk-dot or similar to make a new symlink
